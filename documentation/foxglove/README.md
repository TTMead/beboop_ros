# Foxglove
Foxglove is recommended for visualisation of track/redshell data. A foxglove
layout is provided as `redshell.json`.

Foxglove studio should be run outside of the docker container and can be installed from [here](https://foxglove.dev/download).

Foxglove can then be launched by running `foxglove-studio` and loading the `redshell.json` layout.
